## Mission

As both our company and our focus on collaboration continue to grow, Developer Guidelines are becoming more important than ever.

Our aim is to provide a common set of recommended Developer Guidelines so that any business can choose to use them, or a portion of them in order to:

* Decrease on-boarding time for new developers
* Reduce the long term cost of software maintenance 
* Reduce time spent maintaining your own Guidelines
* Reduce arguments when organization changes bring multiple engineering groups together
* Allow developers to work in code bases that are owned by other businesses
* While the adoption of these guidelines is not strictly required, it is highly recommended, as consistency across code bases allows for easier movement and collaboration.

## In Scope

* Code Styles
  * C
  * C++
  * C#
  * Java
  * JavaScript
  * TypeScript
  * HTML/CSS
  * Objective-C
  * Python
  * Swift
* Code Practices
  * Versioning Best Practices - GIT
  * Packaging Best Practices
  * Unit Testing Best Practices
  * Documentation Best Practices
  * Complexity Rules 
  * Enforcement of all of the above (i.e. Static Analysis)
* Git Best Practices
* New Developer On-Boarding Material
* Trimble Internal Shared Source Requirements

## Out of Scope

This does NOT aim to do the following:

* Force groups to change Technologies
* Force groups to go back and change code
* Force groups to adopt within their own teams
* Prevent teams from maintaining separate guidelines that are optimized for their own situation
